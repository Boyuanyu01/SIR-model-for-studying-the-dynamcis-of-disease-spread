  abstract = {We describe and analyze compartmental models for disease transmission. We begin with models for epidemics, showing how to calculate the basic reproduction number and the final size of the epidemic. We also study models with multiple compartments, including treatment or isolation of infectives. We then consider models including births and deaths in which there may be an endemic equilibrium and study the asymptotic stability of equilibria. We conclude by studying age of infection models which give a unifying framework for more complicated compartmental models.},

  abstract = {We study the qualitative properties of a spatial diffusive heterogeneous SIR model, that appears in mathematical epidemiology to describe the spread of an infectious disease in a population. The model we consider consists in a system of parabolic PDEs. In the first part of the paper, we give a criterion that ensures whether or not an epidemic propagates in a given population. We show how the features of the disease and of the population (rates of infection and of recovery, localisation and diffusivity of individuals) influence the propagation of the epidemic. In particular, we prove that there are situations where "slowing down" the individuals can trigger an epidemic that would not propagate otherwise. In the second part of the paper, we show how the spatial diffusive SIR model qualitatively differs from the usual, purely temporal, SIR model.},
